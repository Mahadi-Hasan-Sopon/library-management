- FIXME:
-
- 1.  You can add a "librarian" role to a specific email/password registered user. By using that
      account, the user can navigate the "All Books" route, and perform all the adding or updating
      operations. But a normal user, not having a "librarian" role, can't do these operations. If you can
      do this, please, provide the email and password of the account which has the "librarian" role in
      the README.md file.
- 2.  Use Axios interceptors for handling network requests.
- 5.  Use ReactToPDF or any relevant package to make the PDF version of the "Read" page of a book.
